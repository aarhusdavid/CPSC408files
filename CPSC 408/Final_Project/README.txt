Project Part 2 + 3
CPSC 408-01

COMMANDS NEEDED TO COMPILE AND RUN (GIVEN THAT THE schema.sql and data.sql FILES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPORTED TO MYSQL WORKBENCH)
Compile: javac FinalJDBC.java
Run: java -classpath .:mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar FinalJDBC

INTERFACE INSTRUCTIONS
The interface is pretty self explanatory, to maneuver through the database you simply enter the number of the option on the menu you would like to proceed with.
The database will continually loop back to the main menu after you complete each option until you decide to exit the database with option '11'.

MISHAPS ABOUT MY PROJECT
The only feature I did not implement into my database was a trigger.
